Export-MySchool-Calendar
========================

Export-MySchool-Calendar is a small Chrome extesion to export the Reykjavík University MySchool calendar to a more convenient format so it can be imported into other applicatoins like: Google Calendar, Apple Calendar (formerly iCal), IBM Lotus Notes, Yahoo! Calendar and many more.

It works by adding an "Export Calendar" button above the calendar in MySchool, when clicked a script parses the DOM and creates a [ics file][1] that is downloaded.

Install
-------
Bring up the extensions management page by clicking the wrench icon and choosing Tools > Extensions.  
If Developer mode has a + by it, click the + to add developer information to the page. The + changes to a -, and more buttons and information appear.  
Click the Load unpacked extension button. A file dialog appears.  
In the file dialog, navigate to your extension's folder and click OK.

Click Choose file and find the file that contains your events, then click Open.

Simply open the ics file and iCal should offer to import the events.

Contribute

The only thing you have to do to contribute is to have [CoffeeScript][2] installed to compile app.coffee and probably have access to Reykjavík University's MySchool system for testing.

* Test with older versions of Chrome
* Test with more applications than just Google Calendar and iCal
* Smart repeat (Rather then repeat events to infinity, only repeat until end of semester)
